- 2025.03.07. blogplus_v2.0.0 open

Manual and automatic options, resolution selection options, and account selection options were added from the previously created 1.0.0 ver.
But so far, only manual and automatic options for 1080p 1 account are implemented.

- 2025.03.07. blogplus_v2.1.0 update

Completely deleted the manual option.
Also adjusted the settings to be compatible with bookmarks on or off.

- 2025.03.07. blogplus_v2.2.0 update

In both account options, we have created new first and second options.
1440p was also created temporarily

- 2025.03.07. blogplus_v2.2.1 update

Added a case with a display screen magnification of 125% and a website screen magnification of 75%.

- 2025.03.11. blogplus_v2.2.2 update

The refresh rate is fixed at 0.3 seconds, but the internal click speed is increased by 0.01 to 0.02 seconds. And I deleted the double click.

- 2025.03.18. blogplus_v2.2.3 update

I've solved a problem that can't be clicked before.
I corrected the inter-click delay from 50, 50, 50, 50, 300 to 90, 20, 20, 20, 200. Depending on some network and computer specifications, it may be difficult to run.
